    "    The classical GD method is an iterative optimization (minimization/maximization) method that uses the gradient of the function as the direction (for maximization problems, the opposite direction for minimization ones) toward which to update the approximate solution: the gradient is computed by approximating its value by using the whole dataset available at each step.\n",

    "    On the other hand, in the SGD we approximate the gradient by only using a subset of points of the dataset, chosen randomly. It can be proven that the SGD yelds the same results as the classical GD, but is computationally more efficient, since we use less data to approximate the gradient of the function at each step.\n",

    "    There are many types of SGD: with or without replacement of the subset of points of the dataset used at each iteration, using only one point or a batch of points as subset, introducing the \"moment\" of the iteration, where we also consider the history of the past directions to update the next, and many more.\n"
